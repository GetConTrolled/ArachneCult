  <h1>Mors Vincit Omnia</h1><br>
  <p>I met a Traveller <br>
    From an antique land<br>
    Who said : <br>
    "Two vast and Trunkless legs of stone<br>
    stand in the desert.<br>
    Near them,<br>
    On the sand,<br>
    Half sunk,<br>
    A shattered visage lies,<br>
    whose frown,<br>
    and wrinkled lip,<br>
    and sneer of cold command,<br>
    tell that its sculptor<br>
    well those passions read<br>
    which yet survive,<br>
    stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
    the hand that mocked them,<br>
    and the heart that fed.<br>
    And on the pedestal<br>
    these words appear:<br>
    "My name is Ozymandias,<br>
    King of Kings.<br>
    Look on my works,<br>
    ye mighty,<br>
    and despair."<br>
    Nothing beside remains.<br>
    Round the decay<br>
    of that colossal wreck,<br>
    boundless and bare,<br>
    the lone and level sands<br>
    stretch far away."<br>
